                Vinay graduate from the University of Warwick with a master’s in mechanical engineering. His dissertation project, simulating biomolecular systems in MATLAB, gave him a taste for coding which quickly evolved into a passion. He went on to further explore this skill developing a domestic hot water simulation program as a project assistant where he used version control systems and Agile SDLC to achieve efficiency, traceability and organisation. He continued developing his programming skills with the Sparta Global Gradate Program where he has received a impressive education in testing in C#. His accomplishments are a testament to his problem-solving ability and analytical mindset. He possesses strong written communication skills developed through extensive report write where he prides himself on writing concise, clear and logical reports. He is able to adapt his communication style to his audience, proven by his variety of work environments, including working to inspire younger people, hospitality and in academia. He consistently preforms whilst working under pressure whilst build strong working relationships with his colleagues and stakeholders. His hobbies extent to both sports and music. Recently moving to London, he has immediately joined a local hockey team, were he participates in weekly training and matches.
